This repository contains scripts and resources for implementing a catching behavior in a robotic environment using imitation learning. The goal of this project is to teach a robot to accurately catch a moving object through the application of machine learning techniques.

The **Catching-With-Imitation-Learning** project is a machine learning-based approach to robotic interaction and movement, focusing on imitation learning to teach a robot to catch an object.

The repository contains:
- **Code** for setting up and modifying the training environment.
- **Scripts** to capture and collect human demonstration data.
- **Tools** for training and evaluating model checkpoints.
- A **final simulation video** that showcases the trained model's performance.

This project was developed as part of the **Freshman Research Initiative** at **UT Austin** in the **Robot Interactive Intelligence (RobIn) Lab**.
