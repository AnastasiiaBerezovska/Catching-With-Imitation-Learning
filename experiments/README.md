## Model Checkpoints

This folder contains model weights saved at various training epochs. Each file (e.g., `model_epoch_50.pth`) represents the model's parameters at a specific stage of training. 

- **Example Checkpoints**:
  - `model_epoch_50.pth` - Early training stage.
  - `model_epoch_500.pth` - Mid-training checkpoint.
  - `model_epoch_1400.pth` - Final training stage.

These checkpoints represent modelâ€™s performance at different stages.
